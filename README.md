## Project overview:

This project will focus on using Cohort Analysis and Data Visualizations to explore the analystical side of business. This will incorporate data cleaning, data manipulation, exploratory analysis, cohort analysis and visualizations. Customer metrics were plotted and the finding interpreted along with providing insights and conclustions to back up reccomendations to marketing, sales and excutives on which marketing sources are worth futher investment and which ones should be scrapped. 

### Product Analaysis:
How many people use it every day, week, and month?
How many sessions are there per day? (One user might have more than one session.)
What is the length of each session?
What's the user retention rate?

2. Sales 
When do people start buying? (In KPI analysis, we're usually interested in knowing the time that elapses between registration and conversion â€” when the user becomes a customer. For example, if registration and the first purchase occur on the same day, the user might fall into category Conversion 0d. If the first purchase happens the next day, it will be Conversion 1d. You can use any approach that lets you compare the conversions of different cohorts, so that you can determine which cohort, or marketing channel, is most effective.)
How many orders do they make during a given period of time?
What is the average purchase size?
How much money do they bring? (LTV)

3. Marketing 
How much money was spent? Overall, per source and over time.
How much did customer acquisition from each of the sources cost?
How worthwhile where the investments? (ROI)
Plot graphs to display how these metrics differ for various devices and ad sources and how they change in time.

After the above analysis is completed, I will relay my findings to the marketing team.
