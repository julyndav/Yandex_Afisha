# Business_Analytics

You've been offered an internship in the analytical department at Yandex.Afisha. Your first task is to help optimize marketing expenses. 

<b>You have access to:</b>
Server logs with data on Yandex.Afisha visits from June 2017 through May 2018
Dump file with all orders for the period
Marketing expenses statistics

<b>Some points analysis will cover: </b>
How people use the product
When they start to buy
How much money each customer brings
When they pay off

### Calculate various metrics and give insights/conlcusions over the following:
1. Product 
How many people use it every day, week, and month?
How many sessions are there per day? (One user might have more than one session.)
What is the length of each session?
What's the user retention rate?

2. Sales 
When do people start buying? (In KPI analysis, we're usually interested in knowing the time that elapses between registration and conversion â€” when the user becomes a customer. For example, if registration and the first purchase occur on the same day, the user might fall into category Conversion 0d. If the first purchase happens the next day, it will be Conversion 1d. You can use any approach that lets you compare the conversions of different cohorts, so that you can determine which cohort, or marketing channel, is most effective.)
How many orders do they make during a given period of time?
What is the average purchase size?
How much money do they bring? (LTV)

3. Marketing 
How much money was spent? Overall, per source and over time.
How much did customer acquisition from each of the sources cost?
How worthwhile where the investments? (ROI)
Plot graphs to display how these metrics differ for various devices and ad sources and how they change in time.

After the above analysis is completed, I will relay my findings to the marketing team.
